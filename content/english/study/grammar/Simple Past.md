#### Structure of the Simple Past

The formation of the simple past tense involves **using the past tense form of the main verb**. For regular verbs, this typically involves adding "-ed" to the base form. Irregular verbs, however, follow unique patterns that need to be memorized.

|Main Verb | Past    |
|:--------:|:-------:|
|Visit     | Visited |
|Go     | Went |


**1. Affirmative Form:**

I/You/He/She/It/We/They worked.

**2. Negative Form:**

To form a negative sentence, use the auxiliary verb "did not" (didn't) followed by the base form of the main verb.

I/You/He/She/It/We/They did not (didn't) work.

**3. Interrogative Form:**

To form a question, invert the subject and the auxiliary verb "did."

Did I/you/he/she/it/we/they work?
