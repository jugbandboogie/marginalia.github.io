## Understanding the Basics

Prepositions are words that establish relationships between elements in a sentence. They indicate direction, location, time, and relationships between nouns and pronouns. Common examples include "in," "on," "at," "by," and "with."

"In" is used for longer periods of time, such as months or years. For example, "She was born in January."

"On" is employed for specific days or dates. For instance, "We'll meet on Friday."

"At" is used for specific points in time, like hours. For example, "The meeting is at 3 p.m."

**2. Location Matters:**

"In" is used for enclosed spaces or general locations. For example, "I am in the library."

"On" is used for surfaces. For instance, "The book is on the table."

"At" is used for specific locations or points. For example, "She is waiting at the bus stop."

**3. Movement and Direction:**

"To" indicates movement towards a destination. For instance, "I am going to the store."
