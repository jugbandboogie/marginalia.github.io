## Understanding "There Is" and "There Are"

**1. Basic Structure:**

"There is" is used for singular nouns or uncountable nouns, indicating the existence of something. For example, "There is a cat in the room" or "There is water in the glass."

"There are" is used for plural nouns, conveying the existence of multiple items. For instance, "There are books on the shelf" or "There are students in the classroom."

To make negative statements, simply add "not" after "is" or "are." For example, "There is not a problem" or "There are not enough chairs."

For questions, invert the subject and the verb. For example, "Is there a park nearby?" or "Are there any snacks in the kitchen?"
