#### Understanding the Simple Present

The simple present tense is used to express habitual actions, general truths, timeless facts, and routines. It is a versatile tense that allows us to describe ongoing states or actions that occur regularly.



#### Formation of Simple Present

The structure of the simple present tense varies depending on the subject, but for most verbs, it involves adding an "-s" to the base form for the third person singular (he, she, it).

**1. Affirmative Form:**

I/You/We/They work.

He/She/It works.

**2. Negative Form:**

To form a negative sentence, use the auxiliary verb "do not" (don't) or "does not" (doesn't) followed by the base form of the main verb.

I/You/We/They do not (don't) work.

He/She/It does not (doesn't) work.

**3. Interrogative Form:**

To form a question, invert the subject and the auxiliary verb "do" or "does."

Do I/you/we/they work?

Does he/she/it work?
