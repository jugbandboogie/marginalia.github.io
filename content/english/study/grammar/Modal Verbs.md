## Understanding

Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express a range of meanings, including ability, possibility, necessity, permission, and more. They are distinct for their ability to modify the meaning of the main verb in a sentence. Let's delve into some key modal verbs and their functions:

**1. Can/Could:**

Can expresses ability or possibility in the present, while could is often used for past ability or more polite requests.
Examples: "She can speak French." "Could you pass me the salt?"

**2. Will/Would:**

Will is used for expressing future intentions or predictions, while would is employed for hypothetical situations, requests, or polite expressions.
Examples: "I will visit you tomorrow." "Would you mind opening the door?"

**3. Shall/Should:**

Shall is often used for suggestions, offers, or future intentions, while should conveys advice or necessity.
Examples: "Shall we go for a walk?" "You should finish your homework."

**4. May/Might:**

May indicates permission or possibility, while might is used for less certain or hypothetical situations.
Examples: "May I borrow your pen?" "It might rain later."

**5. Must:**

Must expresses strong necessity or obligation.
Example: "You must complete the assignment by tomorrow."
