## Understanding

An infinitive is the base form of a verb, typically preceded by the word "to." In English, infinitive verbs come in two forms: the to-infinitive and the bare infinitive.

**1. To-Infinitive:**

The to-infinitive is the most common form of the infinitive and is formed by adding "to" before the base form of the verb. It is used in various contexts, including after certain verbs, as the subject of a sentence, or in noun phrases.

Examples:

"I want to learn a new language."
"She decided to visit the museum."

**2. Bare Infinitive:**

The bare infinitive is the base form of the verb without the "to" particle. It is used after modal verbs (can, will, must, etc.), certain causative verbs, and in imperative sentences.

Examples:

"You should eat your vegetables."
"Let him go."

**2. Distinguish Between to-Infinitive and Bare Infinitive:**

Learn the contexts in which to-infinitives and bare infinitives are used. Practice distinguishing between them in sentences to enhance your overall comprehension.

Exposure to authentic materials such as articles, books, or movies will help you encounter infinitive verbs in real-life contexts. Pay attention to how native speakers use infinitives in different situations.
