## Understanding Polysemy

Polysemy, derived from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "sema" (sign), refers to the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings. These meanings may stem from historical evolution, contextual usage, or metaphorical extensions. For example, the word "bank" can mean a financial institution, the side of a river, or even to tilt to one side.
